# The Langton Ant

This program was written using the Python programming language and implements the Langton Ant problem.

Langton’s Ant is a very simple problem invented by Chris Langton in 1986. It basically covers a set of rules which together determine the behaviour of an ant that colors the ground while moving. 

For more details take a look at my article [Langton’s Ant and Monty’s](Python http://avedo.net/542/langtons-ant-and-montys-python/).
